# This script starts two HTTP servers on different ports:
#  * Port 1234 (using parcel) serves HTML and JavaScript.
#  * Port 1235 (using http-server) serves pretrained model resources.
#
# The reason for this arrangement is that Parcel currently has a limitation that
# prevents it from serving the pretrained models; see
# https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel/issues/1098.  Once that issue is
# resolved, a single Parcel server will be sufficient.

NODE_ENV=development
RESOURCE_PORT=1235


echo Starting the pretrained model server...
node_modules/http-server/bin/http-server dist --cors -p "${RESOURCE_PORT}" > /dev/null & HTTP_SERVER_PID=$!

echo Starting the example html/js server...
# This uses port 1234 by default.
NODE_ENV=development node_modules/parcel-bundler/bin/cli.js serve -d dist index.html --open --no-hmr --public-url /

# When the Parcel server exits, kill the http-server too.
